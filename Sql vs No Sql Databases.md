### Relational or SQL Database

- First you need  to understand **how sql and nosql  databases work**  these are also referred to as **relational  or non-relational**  so let's talk about the sql database.
- **sql**  stands for **structured query  language.** it's a relational database the  easiest way to understand  how sql data is structured is by  comparing it to an excel spreadsheet  
- In relational databases like sql **data is  stored in rows and columns**,  **each row** is a **record** and **each column** is  a **record field** 
- In this example we're  storing user data  we have an `id first name last name email  address physical address and phone number` it  seems pretty straightforward but **what  happens when we want to add another  email address** to this user.

- We'll have to add another column called  `email two`  then if for some reason there's a third  email address then we'll need to add a  column called `email three`  now let's add another record this one.
- only has one email address  so the second and third columns are  going to be blank we'll have the same  issues with adding multiple  physical addresses and phone numbers.  Then let's add some more records  you can see how this is getting out of  control quickly the **database is getting  bloated with these empty fields**  now **because of this relational databases  separate related data into their own  tables**.
- We can **extract the email address  physical address and phone number  columns**  and put **them in their own table** which is  tied back to the **original table record  with an id**  this is where the term relational comes  from the data in these tables are  related.
- So now **we have multiple tables relating  back to the original table of records**  if we want to **get the information** for  **one record we now have to access  multiple tables and join the data back**  together.

- Then there's  **schemas** define **how the structure  or blueprint of how  our data should look schemas in sql are  strict** meaning that the **data field types  must be defined ahead of time**.
- **Adding additional columns or fields to  tables** affects all of the **rows and  records**  in that table and can result in **bloated  tables and failed queries** if they're not  updated properly.
- When it comes to **scaling** most sql  databases only **scale  up vertically and those that can scale  horizontally  are difficult to configure this means**  that you have to upgrade to  larger more expensive servers as your  database grows.  
  
  
  ### Relational or No-SQL Database
  - So why do things have to be so complex  let's go back in time  sql databases have been around since the    and we're mainly focused on  reducing  data duplication since disk storage was  very expensive back then  here's a picture of an ibm 5 megabyte  hard drive  this is the main reason why it's  structured in a tabular format because  of all of this  sql is difficult to understand  structurally it's hard to make  changes to the data structure because of  the rigid schemas  it's inefficient because of multiple  tables being queried  and it's more expensive due to the  vertical scaling  so now let's take a look at nosql or  non-relational databases  most refer to nosql as meaning not sql  but it can also be referred to as not  only sql  in any case the point is that nosql  databases  are structured differently than sql  databases then there's relational versus  non-relational terminology  generally nosql databases are referred  to as  non-relational because they don't store  data in related tables  like sql does a big misconception is  that non-relational databases  cannot store relational data relational  data can be stored  in nosql databases it's just stored  differently  there are several types of nosql  databases there are  key value databases wide column stores  graph databases and document databases  mongodb is a document database instead  of using tables rows and columns  document databases store data in  documents  specifically json javascript object  notation structured documents  if you're familiar with javascript  objects then you're going to be right at  home  with nosql data structures json is  structured as  objects containing key value pairs we  define an object with curly braces  then our key is surrounded by quotes and  lastly our value is separated  from the key by a colon the value can be  a string surrounded by quotes  a number without quotes arrays of values  using square brackets or even another  object  from our previous example of user data  we now have a user record formatted as  json data we have our underscore id  first name last name email address and  phone number  when we have multiple values we can just  use an array to define them  so for the email value we can define  that as an array of email addresses  then we can do the same for the  addresses and phone numbers  so we see here that a single document  stores all the data for each record  instead of splitting up the data  generally data  that is accessed together stays together  although the documents that you work  with are in json format  mongodb actually stores the data on the  server in  bson format bson is an extension of json  and adds  support for expanded data types now the  schemas within mongodb  are very flexible by default there are  no rules in place  you can store any type of data in any  document  this is by design if you want more  structure it can be added at any time  and the scaling in mongodb is very cost  effective  instead of vertical scaling only nosql  databases generally scale horizontally  that means that instead of going up to a  more expensive server  you can utilize multiple cheaper servers  at a fraction of the cost  because of the structure this type of  database is very efficient  easy to understand and easy to modify  and update  let's take a look at some terminology  differences between sql and nosql  so in sql a cluster is a cluster in  nosql  and in sql we have a database also in  nosql we have a database  but here's where the differences come in  in sql we have tables  but in nosql we have collections  in sql we have rows but in nosql we have  documents and sql a column  is in nosql a field now let's take a  look at the mongodb  ecosystem we're going to get a high  level overview of each part  so first we have self hosted this option  will allow you to host your own  mongodb server on your hardware this  requires that  you manage your server updates and any  other maintenance  you can download and use the mongodb  open source community server  on your hardware for free next we have  atlas  so if you don't want to go the old  school route of managing all of this on  your own  you need mongodb atlas atlas utilizes a  software as a service approach  and is a global cloud database as a  service for modern applications  with it you can deploy a fully managed  mongodb server across aws  google cloud and azure with  best-in-class automation and proven  practices  that guarantee availability scalability  and compliance with all of the most  demanding data security and privacy  standards  compass is the gui for mongodb it's  available on  linux mac or windows it allows you to  visually explore your data  run ad hoc queries in seconds interact  with your data with full crud  functionality  view and optimize your query performance  and make smaller decisions about  indexing document validation and much  more  with mongodb realm you can build better  apps faster  with edge to cloud sync and fully  managed back-end services  including triggers functions and graphql  mongodb realm sync handles conflict  resolution  and networking code for you so you can  build better  mobile apps faster mongodb atlas search  makes it easy to build fast relevant  full-text search capabilities  on top of your data in the cloud  available exclusively with mongodb  atlas with search you'll get a  leucine-powered search engine  typo tolerance with fuzzy searching  autocomplete  filters and facets custom scoring and  much more  mongodb charts is a modern data  visualization tool  that is integrated with the mongodb  cloud data platform  charts is the quickest easiest and most  powerful way to visualize  mongodb data or real-time insights  business intelligence  and embedded analytics with atlas online  archive you can tier your data across  fully managed databases and cloud object  storage  and query it through a single endpoint   automatically archive historical data   and save on operational and   transactional data storage costs   without compromising on query   performance   with mongodb atlas data lake you can   query and analyze data across   aws s3 and mongodb atlas in place   in its native format csv files and other   formats using the mongodb   query language save money by storing   your historical data   on aws s3 and then combine and analyze   live and historic data without data   movement   or operational overhead and pay only for   the queries you run   now that you understand the basics of   how mongodb works let's learn more about   atlas the fully managed cloud database   be sure to sign up for   a free account at mongodb.com in the   next video we'll create our first atlas   cluster   and load some sample data if this
