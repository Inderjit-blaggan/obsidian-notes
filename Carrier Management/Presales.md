**Pre-sales Lifecycle:**

- [Salesforce Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3F1pCOjGd4)

The presales professional thus understands what the customer needs, develops an initial view of the solution the customer needs, then tailors the product or service of his company to meet what the customer needs, explains (or helps sell) this solution to the customer, helps close the deal or sale and often stays on to ensure that the delivery team or product specialists that follow him provide the intended solution. Areas of specialty of Presales include:
-   Discovery – a means to uncover details of business problems that the prospect has. The presales person will understand and closely analyses the prospects requirements.
-   Preparation – tailoring a prospect specific presentation or software presentation that precisely meets the needs of the prospect.
-   Demonstration – A demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects business problems. It will be done in a manner that highlights an easy method to solve those problems using the tools available within the vendor’s suite of product.
-   Request for Proposal (RFP) – presales have a detailed knowledge of the product suite, in addition to its application to business problems. As such, presales are frequently involved in technical details in RFP preparation.
-   Marketing assistance – Typically the marketing department and presales department align closely. Given presales is directly in touch with the market, they can share market feedback with the marketing team. Presales will often create the technical detail for use in marketing collateral.
-   Product management assistance – Presales are able to provide unparalleled market feedback to product managers that can be used to influence or provide feedback on product roadmap items.
-   Proposal assistance – Given presales were involved in the sale since the discovery of the prospect business problems, presales will often complete the business analysis and technical component of a sales proposal.


## Pre-sales Lifecycle:

## 1. Assitance with RFI and RFP: 

- RFI (Request for infromation): An RFI (request for information) is a formal process for gathering information from potential suppliers of a good or service. RFIs are intended to be written by customers and sent to potential suppliers. An RFI is typically the first and most broad series of requests intended to narrow down a list of potential vendor candidates.
		- RFIs can be very useful in situations where an organization has little knowledge on possible vendors and wants to reduce the time and cost of evaluating vendors. 
		- RFIs are often used in a variety of instances, for example, in making major [IT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/IT) (information technology) purchases. The goal of using an RFI is to gather information on a market in a formal, structured way. The document should identify the requirements an organization has while requesting specific answers to how the vendor will meet them.
		- To help identify differences among vendors, a good RFI will also focus on requirements that are unique to the inquiring business and on concerns that are less likely to be addressed by every vendor. Recipients are usually asked to submit their responses in a standard format to make comparisons easier.
		RFI vs. RFP vs. RFQ

	- Similar forms to RFIs are requests for proposal (RFPs) and requests for quotation (RFQs). How they all differ is in what situation they are used and what information is included. 
		- An RFP is a more structured document used to gather information from potential vendors. An RFP specifies what the customer is looking for, and it describes each evaluation criterion on which a vendor's proposal will be assessed. RFPs are often used in a bidding process between vendors from a company. An RFP is usually used following an RFI, because it is more specific. 
		- An RFQ is a document that an organization submits to one or more potential suppliers eliciting quotations for a product or service. It is similar to an RFP but is more specific in nature. Typically, an RFQ seeks an itemized list of prices for something that is well-defined and quantifiable, such as hardware. 
		- An RFI is used to request general information and can help determine if a vendor should receive an RFP or RFQ. RFPs should then be used when closer to the idea of making a purchase. If an organization already knows what is needed and only needs a vendor to supply the correct tools, then an RFQ may fit best.

## CAPEX vs. OPEX: An Overview 
- [article link](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/whats-difference-between-capital-expenditures-capex-and-operational-expenditures-opex.asp)
- https://www.10thmagnitude.com/opex-vs-capex-the-real-cloud-computing-cost-advantage/

Businesses have a variety of expenses, from the rent they pay for their factories or offices to the cost of raw materials for their products, to the wages they pay their workers to the overall costs of growing their business. 
- To simplify all of these costs, businesses organize them under different categories. 
- Two of the most common are [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) (CAPEX) : Capital expenditures (CAPEX) are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be used over the long term.
- and [operating expenses](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp) (OPEX): Operating expenses (OPEX) are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.

**CapEx** is defined as business expenses incurred in order to create long-term benefits in the future, such as purchasing fixed assets like a building or equipment. Some examples of IT items that fall under this category would be whole systems and servers, printers and scanners, or air conditioners and generators. You buy these items once and they benefit your business for many, many years. Maintenance of such items is also considered CapEx, as it extends their lifetime and usefulness.

**OpEx** is your operating costs, the expenses to run day-to-day business, like services and consumable items that get used up and are paid for according to use. This includes printer cartridges and paper, electricity, and even yearly services like website hosting or domain registrations. These things are necessary for your business’s success but are not considered major long-term investments like CapEx items.


### KEY TAKEAWAYS

-   Capital expenditures (CAPEX) are a company's major, long-term expenses while operating expenses (OPEX) are a company's day-to-day expenses.
-   Examples of CAPEX include physical assets, such as buildings, equipment, machinery, and vehicles. 
-   Examples of OPEX include employee salaries, rent, utilities, property taxes, and cost of goods sold (COGS).
-   Capital expenditures cannot be deducted from income for tax purposes while operating expenses can be deducted from taxes.

## TCO https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalcostofownership.asp 

Total cost of ownership (TCO) is **an estimation of the expenses associated with purchasing, deploying, using and retiring a product or piece of equipment**

-   The total cost of ownership (TCO) includes the purchase price of a particular asset, plus operating costs, over the asset's lifespan.
-   Looking at the total cost of ownership is a way of assessing the long-term value of a purchase to a company or individual.
-   Corporations use the total cost of ownership as a means of analyzing business deals, while individuals look at the total cost as a way of assessing potential purchases.

## ROI

**Return on investment, or ROI**, is **a mathematical formula that investors can use to evaluate their investments and judge how well a particular investment has performed compared to others**.

## **Planning ahead for a more manageable cloud migration**

In addition to looking beyond cost savings to justify your cloud investment, it’s important to remember that there are a wide variety of reasons a given workload isn’t a fit for the cloud.

Challenges in understanding application dependencies, assessing the feasibility of migration and predicting the costs to run a given workload on-premises versus in the cloud all get in the way of success.

The following steps will help you move forward with a cost-effective cloud migration:

**Assess suitability and identify migration risks**: Analyze application, data and dependencies to determine the most suitable workloads for cloud migration and address potential performance and downtime risks.

**Conduct total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI) analysis**: Equipped with insights into applications, you’ll be able to define the infrastructure requirements to run applications in the cloud at optimal performance and cost.

**Compare the cost-benefit of running each workload in the cloud vs. on-premises:** The next step is to estimate the cost and business impact of running a given workload on-prem or in the cloud.

**Plan and migrate:** From here, you can determine the appropriate migration strategy to move workloads into the cloud with minimal risk. With complete and accurate documentation, you can establish the best migration sequence and apply dependency controls to avoid downtime.

This helps ensure you build the right cloud migration plan from the start.

Getting the right support to streamline cloud procurement, apply cloud cost governance and achieve consistency within a multicloud environment is the foundation of a winning cloud migration game plan.
