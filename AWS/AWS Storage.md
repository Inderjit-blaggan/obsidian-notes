one service over the other and then you have to provide a rational that why a is better than b or b is not good as c so y   is important so let's see why somebody would be interested into using amazon s3 what kind of service it is what it is   going to provide me as a customer let's go ahead and focus on that now   s3 is a storage service right and in storage we divide storage in   technical terms into three categories those three categories of storage is   block storage file storage and then object storage so   these are the three types of storage which we utilize block file and object   so i'll explain what these are and then i'll explain what is s3 and how it is utilized let's try to understand again   from an analogy so you can relate the stuff in your day-to-day life what is the block storage   let's say you bought a piece of land right when you bought a piece of land piece of land what you can do on that that you   can divide it as per your own convenience so i can say hey on this land i am going to create garden   on that green area and in the middle i have building an open space and then i would have a parking for my cars   whatever it is now this is my idea of putting my own way somebody would come and say no   garden won't work for me i want a swimming pool there go ahead deploy a swimming pool use a swimming pool there   open space no i want to create a garden in that open space so go ahead do that so the piece of land is yours you are   the legal owner of that and there you can perform some customization as per   your need now when i say customization it doesn't mean that you can break the   laws let me give an example let's say i bought a piece of land in a residential   area now i can't say that in residential area i am going to open a pub   or i am going to open a casino no that is a commercial activity and for that you have to go into a commercial   location and run your activity from there so legally whatever is allowed in that legal boundary i can divide my   piece of land into different usage and keep on utilizing it so that's what is a   block storage block storage easiest example is your local hard disk   when you have your local hard disk one laptop if you want you can partition it you can format it and you can install   different operating systems on top of it it is purely your hard disk and you decide how you want to use it that is a   block storage a storage which i can partition which i can format i would call that as a block storage   then what is the file storage think yes it is vishal is exactly it's a sand   storage i won't put san always because san can give you a different storage sen   is a network and on that you may have block storage running you may have nfs   storage also running on that so san is exactly yes it is good one but not always the same right and ntf is ntfs is   a file system j which you would create on this block storage or you have ext2 or you have hp   hdfs file system on that it's purely up to you now coming to this file storage example let's say you are into an   apartment so if you're in apartment then you are given a fixed area   now you you can make some modifications in this apartment nobody would stop you you can say hey this is my apartment i   don't like color of the wall so i'm going to change the color of the walls no problem go ahead do that nobody's   stopping you you would say hey i don't like this carpet i want to change the carpet go ahead do that   i don't want to keep closet here i want to shift closet here in the storage area and storage is where i would be putting   closet no problem i want to change the bathtub in the bathroom no problem allowed but you can't say that hey i am   going to break this wall and create a door there no it won't be allowed it   would be it would be interfering with someone else in your neighbor side so we don't want that to allow so that is not   allowed you can't say i would close this door permanently and make a door from here no it's not allowed so there is a   storage which is yours but you are allowed to use that storage but cannot   perform things like formatting or partitioning that is an apartment right keep that example at back of your mind   we will relate it to technical terms in a minute efs fsx exactly these are all your file storage we'll talk more on   that we make object storage now if i give you my example like i was   working in dubai for a long time and then what i did i moved from dubai to london   so from dxb i moved to london heathrow now when i moved   i had lot of stuff which i wanted to bring with me to london but i didn't have this place i didn't finalize where   i am going to stay into london so what i did i packaged all my stuff into these type of boxes   and rented a unit like this in dubai this unit is storage unit   this has a lock-in key and i would be storing my data inside it i would be   putting my stuff into the boxes i have the lock and key mechanism on that but this unit is only designed to store   stuff it is not designed for humans to live it is not designed for light it is not   having maybe cooling or power it is just a storage place where i can keep my stuff and i kept that stuff for i think   around two months once i settled in london i asked the courier company to get all the stuff and bring it back to   me in london so they couriered me back into london so what i did here i paid for only two months of storage capacity   here and if i had less stuff i could only pay for the per box   not even the whole unit so if i'm not looking for whole unit i can say i am going to use only a box i would put my   stuff and you charge me only for that box nothing beyond it so that is the example of object storage purely   designed to put your stuff nothing else that is the object storage let me explain a little bit more on the   technical terms how these things actually work so when i'm talking about block storage my unit of transaction is   block this would be your hard disk right this is your hard disk on this hard disk you   would have a operating system running windows linux whatever and this operating system is going to format this   hard disk into different block sizes depending on the linux operating system or windows you may have a 4k block size   or 8k block size it is purely up to you how you want to format it so transaction   of units so when i say hey i am going to store my resume on this hard disk   that resume information goes to operating system let's say this block is 4 kb   my resume is 20 kb now obviously my operating system will need to have 5 blocks allocated to my   resume so it will find out let's use block one here block two here block three here block four here and block   five here and let's store resume of ashish so that is being taken care by my block   storage which is my block unit of transaction right when i'm talking about file storage things are little different what   happens in file storage in a file storage you are accessing things like something like this slash   server name slash folder name and in that folder you would   have your folders created and you would be storing your files there you would say i want to create a file i may want   to update a file i may want to delete a file i want to share a file so you can perform file   level operation here your unit of transaction is file that's what you can do here in object storage objects are   also in a way file but they have additional information which is called metadata so objects have additional   information with them that is called metadata and we'll discuss what metadata is in a minute but this is how my unit   of transaction actually works right second difference examples   laptop disk is block storage when you are accessing something on network that is your file storage windows share like   you are connecting to z drive with your slash server name so we are utilizing and then we have object storage which is   one drive google drive dropbox where you just upload your file using http download it whenever you need that's all   you need to worry about that's all we mean by uh examples of object storage let's go a little bit more on that   how can you update and this is important this is very very important from design perspective   in block storage if i had to resume return and in that resume i made a spelling mistake i can go and update that   spelling mistake and click button of save and only that block would get updated nothing else   so you can directly update the file same can happen in file storage also i can open that file   slash server slash file name and update that individual file no problem at all on that so that is all possible you can   use that now in object storage this is now how things   work object storage work little differently so you cannot object the object directly let me give you an   example on that now see let me go back to sorry give me   a minute let me go back to my previous example   yeah this one let's see let's assume that i have a box here as   you see this box here in the sorry uh very back   here this box so this box which you are seeing here this box is what i want to let's say   modify i'm sure sorry for that my pen is not working as expected let me try again   so this is the box right now in this box i want to modify something   now i do not have open space in that unit that i can modify the box so what i   have to do first i have to get that box out i got my box out modified it whatever i   wanted removed added whatever and then i'll push it back into my storage space   that's how it works i can't directly go and edit the box within that storage   unit i have to get it downloaded upload it again after modification so that's   what we mean that we are not directly modifying the object what you have to do   you have to first go ahead and take care of things first and then only   you would be able to modify that stuff so what you will do you would be going   and updating the object directly answer is no you would be creating either a new version of the object or you will be   replacing the existing version of the object that's how we would be connecting to right   protocols when i am trying to connect through block storage i use protocol xcozy fiber channel serial ata so if   you're coming from on-prem world you would obviously relate this stuff to scuzzy fiber channel or other type of   things file storage is smb cifs nfs these are the type of file storages and then   object storage is mostly we access using the protocol like http https or rest or   soap call that's how we access the object storage all right now what are the examples in   aws we will talk that but here is one more additional information that is called   metadata now what is metadata metadata is additional information which   i am storing with my object that is called my metadata so block storage and file storage do not   support metadata metadata is a very unique feature which most of the object storages support what   is metadata consider you have a box right now   on that box you can say hey on this box i would put a label and that label will say what is inside the content of this   box so i can put a label that this one is my kitchen stuff i can put another label on top and that   one can be say that is a fragile item it may get break then i can say the weight   for that is 20 kg what i did on the outer surface of the   box i have added extra information that exactly what a metadata is so object   storages allows you to hold metadata information which is additional information about that object so we   would be talking about what metadata now sometime people get confused with metadata and file system attribute let   me explain that also every file system maintains some information   but it is different let me show some details here so let's say i am having my uh   windows machine and i have a file here called delivery.jpg if i select its properties   and go to that property of a file let's see what we see so it's a jpeg file and here are my   details tab my operating system has added these things tags author date   taken image id dimension width height and all the stuff right so this is maybe   if it was a picture click the camera information may also come with that and that would be added by the camera this   is my jpeg file it has different information if i have a text file text file would have additional information   which will be different so this one has less information like size folder now i can't add a tag here which says cost of   this file or expiry date of this file that is not we can add here these   attributes are maintained by file system so these are yes metadata but our object   storage have a different way that you can bring your own metadata into the system if you want to so hopefully you   are clear now that what is my metadata so metadata is supported by object   storage it is not supported by other operating systems right   example in aws block storage is ebs amazon instant store is another example   of block storage we'll talk about these two in next session when we discuss ec2 then file storage is efs and fsx these   are service name and then the services are amazon s3 and glacier which are called my object storage so we'll talk   about object storage now we will focus on amazon s3
